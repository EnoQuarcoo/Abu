This website's purpose is to get people who are college aged and give them advice on how to invest for the future based on factors such as how much money they currently have and their debts and then see what their investments purposes are and then give them advice on what to invest in such as stocks or property. We came up with this idea because studies have shown that a lot of kids from age 18-25 want to invest money, but they just do not know how to start. So our web site will also give advice on the first things to do about investing. The name Abu came from Black Rocks's software Aladdin and it goes well with the theme because Abu was the monkey in the money that was Aladdin's best friend and his assistant just like our project Abu is here to assist.
